 * Pass-by-value
 *   - A copy of the data is being passed
 *   - Changes made to the copy inside the method does
 *          not affect the original
 *
 * Pass-by-reference
 *   - The address is passed in
 *   - Any changes made to the parameter in the method affects
 *           the argument that was passed in when the method was
 *           called
 *
 * Java only supports pass by value, but when you pass a reference
 * type variable as an argument the value that is copied into the 
 * method is a memory address. Any changes you make inside the method's
 * body will effect the actual object the argument was pointing to.
